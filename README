In this repository I will collect useful relax-ng grammars in the compact syntax (.rnc files).

Also present is a schemas.xml file that can be used to locate
appropriate (here provided) schemas for files.

In Emacs, add the schemas.xml file to `rng-schema-locating-files' to
start using these grammars.
